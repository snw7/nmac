This script can be used to change a devices MAC address, hostname (and therefore also IP address). It supports several modes. Information is supplied in the `-h` option.

## Installation
Add this line to your .zshrc file:
`alias nmac='~/path/to/file/nmac.sh'`

## Dependencies
Install the 'spoof-mac' package. I suggest using homebrew
`brew install spoof-mac`
